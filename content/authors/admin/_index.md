I am a postdoc research fellow in the Departments of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at Duke University working with [Prof. Anru Zhang](https://anruzhang.github.io/index.html). I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Biostatistics & Computational Biology at University of Rochester under the supervision of [Prof. Xing Qiu](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/biostat/people/faculty/qiu.aspx) in 2024. My research interests include functional data analysis, image processing and high dimensional data anlaysis. My thesis research attempts to bridge the gap between mathematics and statistics by applying mathematical techniques in novel ways to solve statistical problems. For my thesis work, I have developed a new kernel smoothing-finite element method (FEM) which applies the FEM method for discretizing partial differential equations to kernel smoothing tasks. The new method is designed to ensure efficiency and stability in high-dimensional scenarios. The primary applications for my work are in image processing and denoising tasks, which play an essential role in neuroimaging studies. I actively seek extensive collaborations across departments, which help me build a strong foundation in translational data science while moving toward my broader goal of developing statistical tools for high-dimensional biomedical applications. Fun fact: my Erdős number is 3.
