abstract: This paper demonstrates the inherent capacity of the ensemble learning approach
  to stabilize the notoriously difficult to tune echo state network (ESN) learning
  machines. ESN learning machines belong to a class of recurrent neural networks made
  popular because of their ability to perform predictively well on time series data.
  However, for any given task, building the corresponding optimal ESN is notoriously
  hard because of the instability of the tuning process. In this paper, we harness
  the high predictive variance by building ensembles made up of lightly tuned ESNs,
  and then combining those ESNs (base learners) rather than seeking the daunting task
  of selecting a single one. Throughout this paper, all our examples consistently
  demonstrate substantial reductions in average prediction error as a result of using
  the aggregate learning machine in place of the single one.
