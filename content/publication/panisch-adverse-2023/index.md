abstract: Objective  Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with negative
  prenatal and perinatal health outcomes and may, via these pathways, have intergenerational
  effects on child health and development. We examine the impact of ACEs on maternal
  salivary cortisol, a key measure of prenatal biology previously linked with pregnancy-related
  health outcomes. Methods  Leveraging assessments across three trimesters, we used
  linear mixed-effects models to analyze the influence of ACEs on maternal prenatal
  diurnal cortisol patterns in a diverse cohort of pregnant women (analytic sample,
  n = 207). Covariates included comorbid prenatal depression, psychiatric medications,
  and sociodemographic factors. Results  Maternal ACEs were significantly associated
  with flatter diurnal cortisol slopes (i.e., less steep decline), after adjusting
  for covariates, with effects consistent across gestation (estimate = 0.15, standard
  error = 0.06, p = .008). Conclusions  ACEs experienced before pregnancy may have
  a robust and lasting influence on maternal prenatal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  activity throughout gestation, a key biological marker associated with perinatal
  and child health outcomes. The findings suggest one route of intergenerational transmission
  of early adverse experiences and underscore the potential value of assessing prepregnancy
  adverse experiences for promoting perinatal and maternal and child health.
