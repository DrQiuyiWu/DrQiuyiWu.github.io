Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with negative prenatal and perinatal health outcomes and may, via these pathways, have intergenerational effects on child health and development. We examine the impact of ACEs on maternal salivary cortisol, a key measure of prenatal biology previously linked with pregnancy-related health outcomes.
Methods 
Leveraging assessments across three trimesters, we used linear mixed-effects models to analyze the influence of ACEs on maternal prenatal diurnal cortisol patterns in a diverse cohort of pregnant women (analytic sample, n = 207). Covariates included comorbid prenatal depression, psychiatric medications, and sociodemographic factors.
Results 
Maternal ACEs were significantly associated with flatter diurnal cortisol slopes (i.e., less steep decline), after adjusting for covariates, with effects consistent across gestation (estimate = 0.15, standard error = 0.06, p = .008).
Conclusions 
ACEs experienced before pregnancy may have a robust and lasting influence on maternal prenatal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity throughout gestation, a key biological marker associated with perinatal and child health outcomes. The findings suggest one route of intergenerational transmission of early adverse experiences and underscore the potential value of assessing prepregnancy adverse experiences for promoting perinatal and maternal and child health.},
