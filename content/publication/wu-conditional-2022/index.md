abstract: This study develops a statistical conditional approach to evaluate climate
  model performance in wind speed and direction and to project their future changes
  under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario over inland and
  offshore locations across the continental United States (CONUS). The proposed conditional
  approach extends the scope of existing studies by a combined characterization of
  the wind direction distribution and conditional distribution of wind on the direction,
  hence enabling an assessment of the joint wind speed and direction distribution
  and their changes. A von Mises mixture distribution is used to model wind directions
  across models and climate conditions. Wind speed distributions conditioned on wind
  direction are estimated using two statistical methods, i.e., a Weibull distributional
  regression model and a quantile regression model, both of which enforce the circular
  constraint to their resultant estimated distributions. Projected uncertainties associated
  with different climate models and model internal variability are investigated and
  compared with the climate change signal to quantify the robustness of the future
  projections. In particular, this work extends the concept of internal variability
  in the climate mean to the standard deviation and high quantiles to assess the relative
  magnitudes to their projected changes. The evaluation results show that the studied
  climate model captures both historical wind speed and wind direction and their dependencies
  reasonably well over both inland and offshore locations. Under the RCP8.5 scenario,
  most of the studied locations show no significant changes in the mean wind speeds
  in both winter and summer, while the changes in the standard deviation and 95th
  quantile show some robust changes over certain locations in winter. Specifically,
  high wind speeds (95th quantile) conditioned on direction in winter are projected
  to decrease in the northwestern, Colorado, and northern Great Plains locations in
  our study. In summer, high wind speeds conditioned on direction over the southern
  Great Plains increase slightly, while high wind speeds conditioned on direction
  over offshore locations do not change much. The proposed conditional approach enables
  a combined characterization of the wind speed distributions conditioned on direction
  and wind direction distributions, which offers a flexible alternative that can provide
  additional insights for the joint assessment of speed and direction.
