abstract: Recommender systems are the engine of online advertising. Not only do they
  suggest movies, music, or romantic partners, but they also are used to select which
  advertisements to show to users. This paper reviews the basics of recommender system
  methodology and then looks at the emerging arena of active recommender systems.
