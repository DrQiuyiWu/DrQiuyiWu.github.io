abstract: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in pregnancy has attracted
  considerable research attention, in part, because it may be a mechanism by which
  diverse prenatal exposures alter perinatal and child health outcomes. Symptoms of
  affective disturbance and stress are among the most-studied prenatal factors associated
  with HPA axis alterations, but there remains uncertainty about the nature of the
  association because of the limitations to, and variability in, data collection and
  analytic approaches. The current study capitalized on a prospective, longitudinal
  pregnancy cohort that examined salivary diurnal cortisol, collected at 5 time points
  across the day, at each trimester in a diverse sample of women. Detailed data on
  affective symptoms and major life events were collected at each trimester, as were
  data on health behaviors, medication, and socio-demographics. Results indicated
  modest stability of individual differences in diurnal cortisol across pregnancy,
  which was evident for diurnal slope (ICC = .20) and measures of total output (area
  under the curve, ICC = .25); substantial gestation-related increases in total cortisol
  output across pregnancy was also observed (p textless .001). Adjusting for health
  behaviors, medication, and socio-demographic covariates, elevated levels of depressive
  symptoms and major life events were significantly (p textless .05) associated with
  a higher morning awakening value and flatter diurnal slope, which was evident across
  all trimesters. In addition to the normative gestation-related changes in cortisol
  production, our results demonstrate selective but robust associations between psychological
  symptoms, stressors, and the HPA axis across gestation, and suggest both methodological
  and mechanistic strategies for future study.
