	abstract = {Objective 
          Adverse childhood experiences ({ACEs}) are associated with negative prenatal and perinatal health outcomes and may, via these pathways, have intergenerational effects on child health and development. We examine the impact of {ACEs} on maternal salivary cortisol, a key measure of prenatal biology previously linked with pregnancy-related health outcomes.
          Methods 
          Leveraging assessments across three trimesters, we used linear mixed-effects models to analyze the influence of {ACEs} on maternal prenatal diurnal cortisol patterns in a diverse cohort of pregnant women (analytic sample, n = 207). Covariates included comorbid prenatal depression, psychiatric medications, and sociodemographic factors.
          Results 
          Maternal {ACEs} were significantly associated with flatter diurnal cortisol slopes (i.e., less steep decline), after adjusting for covariates, with effects consistent across gestation (estimate = 0.15, standard error = 0.06, p = .008).
          Conclusions 
          {ACEs} experienced before pregnancy may have a robust and lasting influence on maternal prenatal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity throughout gestation, a key biological marker associated with perinatal and child health outcomes. The findings suggest one route of intergenerational transmission of early adverse experiences and underscore the potential value of assessing prepregnancy adverse experiences for promoting perinatal and maternal and child health.},

	abstract = {This study develops a statistical conditional approach to evaluate climate model performance in wind speed and direction and to project their future changes under the Representative Concentration Pathway ({RCP}) 8.5 scenario over inland and offshore locations across the continental United States ({CONUS}). The proposed conditional approach extends the scope of existing studies by a combined characterization of the wind direction distribution and conditional distribution of wind on the direction, hence enabling an assessment of the joint wind speed and direction distribution and their changes. A von Mises mixture distribution is used to model wind directions across models and climate conditions. Wind speed distributions conditioned on wind direction are estimated using two statistical methods, i.e., a Weibull distributional regression model and a quantile regression model, both of which enforce the circular constraint to their resultant estimated distributions. Projected uncertainties associated with different climate models and model internal variability are investigated and compared with the climate change signal to quantify the robustness of the future projections. In particular, this work extends the concept of internal variability in the climate mean to the standard deviation and high quantiles to assess the relative magnitudes to their projected changes. The evaluation results show that the studied climate model captures both historical wind speed and wind direction and their dependencies reasonably well over both inland and offshore locations. Under the {RCP}8.5 scenario, most of the studied locations show no significant changes in the mean wind speeds in both winter and summer, while the changes in the standard deviation and 95th quantile show some robust changes over certain locations in winter. Specifically, high wind speeds (95th quantile) conditioned on direction in winter are projected to decrease in the northwestern, Colorado, and northern Great Plains locations in our study. In summer, high wind speeds conditioned on direction over the southern Great Plains increase slightly, while high wind speeds conditioned on direction over offshore locations do not change much. The proposed conditional approach enables a combined characterization of the wind speed distributions conditioned on direction and wind direction distributions, which offers a flexible alternative that can provide additional insights for the joint assessment of speed and direction.},

	abstract = {The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA}) axis in pregnancy has attracted considerable research attention, in part, because it may be a mechanism by which diverse prenatal exposures alter perinatal and child health outcomes. Symptoms of affective disturbance and stress are among the most-studied prenatal factors associated with {HPA} axis alterations, but there remains uncertainty about the nature of the association because of the limitations to, and variability in, data collection and analytic approaches. The current study capitalized on a prospective, longitudinal pregnancy cohort that examined salivary diurnal cortisol, collected at 5 time points across the day, at each trimester in a diverse sample of women. Detailed data on affective symptoms and major life events were collected at each trimester, as were data on health behaviors, medication, and socio-demographics. Results indicated modest stability of individual differences in diurnal cortisol across pregnancy, which was evident for diurnal slope ({ICC} = .20) and measures of total output (area under the curve, {ICC} = .25); substantial gestation-related increases in total cortisol output across pregnancy was also observed (p {\textless} .001). Adjusting for health behaviors, medication, and socio-demographic covariates, elevated levels of depressive symptoms and major life events were significantly (p {\textless} .05) associated with a higher morning awakening value and flatter diurnal slope, which was evident across all trimesters. In addition to the normative gestation-related changes in cortisol production, our results demonstrate selective but robust associations between psychological symptoms, stressors, and the {HPA} axis across gestation, and suggest both methodological and mechanistic strategies for future study.},

	abstract = {Sometimes the Joint Statistical Meetings ({JSM}) is frustrating to attend, because multiple sessions on the same topic are scheduled at the same time. This article uses seeded latent Dirichlet allocation and a scheduling optimization algorithm to very significantly reduce overlapping content in the original schedule for the 2020 {JSM} program. Specifically, a measure based on total variation distance that ranges from 0 (random scheduling) to 1 (no overlapping content) finds that the original schedule had a score of 0.058, whereas our proposed schedule achieved a score of 0.371. This is a huge improvement that would (i) increase participant satisfaction as measured by the post-{JSM} satisfaction survey, and (ii) save the American Statistical Association significant money by obviating the need for the traditional in-person meeting of the 47 program chairs and other organizers. The methodology developed in this work immediately applies to future {JSMs} and is easily modified to improve scheduling for any other scientific conference that has parallel sessions.},

However, for any given task, building the corresponding optimal {ESN} is notoriously hard because of the instability of the tuning process. In this paper, we harness the high predictive variance by building ensembles made up of lightly tuned {ESNs}, and then combining those {ESNs} (base learners) rather than seeking the daunting task of selecting a single one. Throughout this paper, all our examples consistently demonstrate substantial reductions in average prediction error as a result of using the aggregate learning machine in place of the single one.},
